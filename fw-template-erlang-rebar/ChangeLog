Version 0.1.0 (molinaro)
  * add dialyzer support to make check when rebar doesn't support dialyzer

Version 0.0.2 (molinaro)
  * add maintainer-clean which removes all symlinks and the origin checkout
  * better checks before building .app file
  * NO_DIALZYER and NO_EUNIT now control whether to turn off dialyzer or eunit
    with make check (these can be set to anything in the Makefile.am.local in
    the root of a project).

Version 0.0.1 (molinaro)
  * copy c_src verbatim, sometimes there's depth there
  * allow dialyzer to be skipped

Version 0.0.0 (molinaro)

  works
