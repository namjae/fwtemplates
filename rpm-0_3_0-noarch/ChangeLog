    to Paul and he wanted new BSD, so this has that license.

Version 0.2.9 (molinaro)
  * For whatever reason 'make install' was failing, well okay the reason was
    the variable for the directory to install some things was wrong, however
    it still seemed to build rpms fine, so I didn't catch it.

Version 0.2.8 (molinaro)
