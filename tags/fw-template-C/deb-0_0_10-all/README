fw-template-C is a C development template for framewerk.  It provides:

  * automake setup: libtool and compiler setup done for you.

  * pkg-config integration: pkg-config files for your project are made for 
  you.  In addition, if any dependencies provide pkg-config files they
  are used, generally eliminating the need for AC_CHECK_LIBS and 
  AC_CHECK_HEADERS.

  * valgrind integration: standard targets for running make check with
  valgrind.

  * coverage integration: standard configure and make check support for 
  enabling coverage analysis.  guards against releasing packages with
  coverage enabled.
