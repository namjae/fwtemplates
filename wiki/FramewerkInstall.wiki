#summary How to install framewerk
#labels Phase-Deploy

= Introduction =

This page will assist you in installing framewerk.

= The Easy Way =

If you are running a debian package based system (Debian, Ubuntu, [http://www.finkproject.org/ Mac OS/X with fink], etc.), just go to the 
[http://code.google.com/p/fwtemplates/downloads/list downloads section] and grab the latest {{{.deb}}} files.

= The Less Easy Way =

Prerequisites:
    1. automake, preferably 1.9 or better.
    1. autoconf, preferable 2.5 or better.
    1. (gnu) make
    1. cvs [[#1 1]]

If you are not running a debian based system, or you just like to kick the tires, 
go to the [http://code.google.com/p/fwtemplates/downloads/list downloads section] and grab the latest {{{.tar.gz}}} file.

{{{
# tar -zxf framewerk-0.1.15.tar.gz
# cd framewerk-0.1.15
# ./bootstrap && ./build --prefix=/usr/local && make -s check
...
}}}
The default prefix is {{{/usr}}} so if you are ok with that you can omit the prefix argument.  Hopefully what you see[[#2 2]] is something like
{{{
PASS: test-template-fw-build
PASS: test-template-fw-template
PASS: test-template-script
PASS: test-cvs
==================
All 4 tests passed
==================
}}}

Now you can either {{{make install}}} to just stick stuff on your system, or you can build your own debian package if you are on a debian based system. To do the latter type
{{{
# env FW_DUPLOAD_ARGS="-no" make release
...
}}}
which should run the tests again and ultimately produce a {{{.deb}}} in {{{fw-pkgout/}}} in the root directory of the project which you can install.[[#3 3]]
{{{
# ls fw-pkgout/
framewerk-build_0.1.15_i386.deb  framewerk_0.1.15_all.deb
# sudo dpkg -i fw-pkgout/framewerk_0.1.15_all.deb 
Selecting previously deselected package framewerk.
(Reading database ... 17065 files and directories currently installed.)
Unpacking framewerk (from .../framewerk_0.1.15_all.deb) ...
Setting up framewerk (0.1.15) ...

#
}}}

That's it.

= Footnotes =

== 1 ==
Not strictly required but test-cvs will fail 'make check' since it exercises the cvs revision control hooks.

== 2 ==
If you see something like:
{{{
fw requires GNU make to build, you are using bsd make
*** Error code 1

Stop.
}}}
Then you are using bsd make which will not work.  Try again with gnu make.

== 3 ==
The FW_DUPLOAD_ARGS="-no" stuff is to cause dupload to do a dry run.  Framewerk wants to upload the package it makes to a repository and I'm assuming you don't have one.  If you do you can use FW_DUPLOAD_ARGS="-t name_of_my_archive".  For your own projects you can even hard code this in.  Check out {{{fw-pkgin/config}}} if you are interested.
