#summary Me sorting out what the differences between deb and rpm package hooks are.
 
= Introduction =

I'm adding RPM support to framewerk.  It turns out, unsurprisingly, the package scripts have different semantics in RPM vs. DEB.  Most people will probably just develop for one or the other so they can write scripts into {{{fw-pkgin/}}} that don't work for both, no big deal.  However sometimes cross-packaging hooks need to be written (e.g., automatic [http://code.google.com/p/erlrc/ erlrc] integration into fw-template-erlang [FwTemplateErlangWalkthrough fw-template-erlang]), which is the point of the {{{make-hook}}} package method, but now I have to figure it out.

From an [http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging/ScriptletSnippets RPM reference] and a [http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-maintainerscripts.html DEB reference], I cobbled together this understanding.

= Install =

|| RPM || DEB ||
||  %pretrans of new package || - ||
|| %pre of new package || new-preinst install ||
|| _new package installed_ || _new package files unpacked_ ||
|| %post of new package || - ||
|| %posttrans of new package || postinst configure most-recently-configured-version ||

= Updates =

|| RPM || DEB ||
||  %pretrans of new package || old-prerm upgrade new-version ||
||  %pre of new package || new-preinst upgrade old-version ||
|| _new package installed_ || _new package files unpacked_ ||
|| %post of new package || - ||
|| %preun of old package || old-postrm upgrade new-version [[#1 1]]  || 
|| _removal of old package_ || _"old but not new" package files removed_ ||
|| %postun of old package || - ||
|| %posttrans of new package || postinst configure most-recently-configured-version ||

Correspondence here is sketchy, due to the different models: RPM basically does an install followed by an erase, whereas DEB considers the upgrade as a single operation; thus, the "post-install" ({{{%post}}} vs. {{{postinst}}}) is done in very different places in the two models.

Finally the arguments are different:

  * RPM passes the installation count to the scriptlets which implicitly indicates install vs. upgrade, whereas DEB uses a sum type.
  * RPM does not pass the previous version information; recent versions of RPM can be called from scriptlets but presumably {{{rpm -q}}} will return a different result after the _new package installed_ step in the above chain.

{{{new-postrm failed-upgrade old-version}}} is invoked if {{{old-postrm upgrade new-version}}} fails, so one can ensure the new postrm is always called if desired.
